I've worked on a theft detection system using Convolutional LSTM networks with TensorFlow and Keras. This project involves detecting instances of shoplifting from surveillance video clips.

🔹 Data Organization: I started by organizing the dataset, which included separating videos into categories of "0" (no shoplifting) and "1" (shoplifting).

🔹 Video Preprocessing: Using OpenCV, I extracted frames from each video, normalized them, and prepared them in sequences to feed into the neural network.

🔹 Model Architecture: I built a ConvLSTM-based neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. This architecture is designed to capture features from video sequences effectively.

🔹 Training and Evaluation: The model was trained on preprocessed video data, focusing on optimizing accuracy and handling imbalanced classes. I used techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting.

🔹 Performance Evaluation: I evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision: [0.82], recall: [0.99], and F1-score: [0.90147783 0.04761905]. Additionally, I visualized the results using confusion matrices.

This project was a great opportunity to dive deep into video analysis and apply advanced deep-learning techniques for real-world applications like theft detection in surveillance systems.
